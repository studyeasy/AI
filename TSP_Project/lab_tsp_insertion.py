Author: Diarmuid Grimes, based on code of Alejandro Arbelaez
Insertion heuristics for quickly generating (non-optimal) solution to TSP
File contains two heuristics. 
First heuristic inserts the closest unrouted city to the previous city 
added to the route.
Second heuristic inserts randomly chosen unrouted city directly after its 
nearest city on the route
